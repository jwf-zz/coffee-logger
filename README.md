This script reads from a RFIDeas badge reader, logs the badge number to a Parse app, and then puts out 3.3V on GPIO pin 25 for 60 seconds.

This is intended for use on a Raspberry Pi, Model B.

This requires an additional file, settings.py, which I am not including here as it contains the Parse Application keys. Contact Jordan Frank if you require the keys. If you want to use this with your own Parse App, then get your own keys and update appropriate.

Enjoy.
